     HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup language. 
     It is the basic programming language to structure websites 
     and is mainly used for inserting and displaying text, images, basic shapes, etc. 
     HTML is not good at making a webpage's aesthetics, however. CSS and Javascript are much 
     better for making page look good.

      I chose this Web Design Course because I am highly intrigued by the world of programming. 
      No matter what career path I choose, being able to create an effective website will always help me. 
      It might even help me qualify for more jobs. Another reason I chose this course was because my Freshman Computer Applications teacher took my class through a HTML and CSS course that taught the basics of those two languages and how to make a simple website. 
      That  2 month-long course was fun and interesting for me, so I ended up finding this course, which made me very excited. 
      I can't wait to learn all I can about web developement and design from Mr. Spriggs.
